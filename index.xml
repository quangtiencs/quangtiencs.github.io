      <description>Hello, this is quangtiencs’s log, a homepage of my engineering life.
I’m Tien Le-Quang (Lê Quang Tiến), a computer and data scientist. I like to write scalable algorithms to solve real-world problems, learn from massive datasets to understand data. As a young engineer with full energy, I am on the road to becoming a world-class engineer, a good statistician… and a wonderful father (btw I don’t have a girlfriend at the present :D).</description>
